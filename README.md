## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Generates amplify GraphQL code by running `amplify codegen`, and then runs the app in the development mode through `react-scripts start`, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, lint errors will be seen in the console.


### `npm test`
Generates amplify GraphQL code by running `amplify codegen`, and then launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode through `react-scripts test`.


### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes, the app is ready to be deployed.
